This repository holds materials for one of my conference presentations 
[@Pierce-RN8577]. Its primary purpose is for me to use version control tools 
while developing my slides, but its secondary purposes include distributing the 
slides and example files to my audience and demonstrating how to use Quarto to 
create slides. *If you find these materials useful or would like to offer*
*constructive feedback, please email me at*
*[pierces1@msu.edu](mailto:pierces1@msu.edu).*

There are two different types of users of this repository: myself and my
audience. I assume most of my audience just wants copies of my slides, but some
may want to see exactly how they were created by examining other parts of the
repository (especially the Quarto scripts).

Since there are no other contributors, I am omitting details that may
otherwise be useful to collaborators. However, here is a link to my web page on
[software for reproducible research with R](https://sjpierce.github.io/rr_software.html). 
This presentation uses the Quarto extension called `reveal-header` 
(https://github.com/shafayetShafee/reveal-header). Installing that created the 
`_extensions/` subfolder here.  

## Obtaining the Slides & Example Files
For each of the links below, you will land on a GitHub page that has a 
*Download raw file* button in the upper right corner of the screen. Its icon
looks like an arrow pointing down into a tray. It is just to the left of the
pencil icon. Use that to download each file to your computer.

The `*.qmd` files are Quarto scripts, while the corresponding `*.html` files are 
the resulting rendered output. The output should work in common web browsers 
like Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. The Quarto scripts can be opened in any standard 
text editor, though I personally use RStudio for reasons explained in the 
presentation itself. 

* [`Slides.qmd`](https://github.com/sjpierce/Pierce.AEA2024/blob/main/Slides.qmd)
* [`Slides.html`](https://github.com/sjpierce/Pierce.AEA2024/blob/main/Slides.html) 
  *If you just want a copy of the final slides, this is it!*
* [`Create_MyStudy_Data.qmd`](https://github.com/sjpierce/Pierce.AEA2024/blob/main/scripts/Create_MyStudy_Data.qmd) 
* [`Create_MyStudy_Data.html`](https://github.com/sjpierce/Pierce.AEA2024/blob/main/scripts/output/Create_MyStudy_Data.html)
* [`MyStudy_Report.qmd`](https://github.com/sjpierce/Pierce.AEA2024/blob/main/scripts/MyStudy_Report.qmd)  
* [`MyStudy_Report.html`](https://github.com/sjpierce/Pierce.AEA2024/blob/main/scripts/output/MyStudy_Report.html) 

## Usage Tips

* After you open the `Slides.html` file on your computer, press the `s` key on 
  your keyboard to see the speaker view that contains my speaker notes. 
* There are also other 
  [slide navigation keyboard shortcuts](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html). 
* Try opening both a Quarto script and the output it generates and look at them 
  side-by-side. For more intensive examination of how things work, see the 
  Rendering the Scripts section below. 

## Repository Structure and Contents
The structure for the repository is shown in the outline below, where folder names 
and file names are `highlighted like this` and comments are in normal text.
The repository is set up as an 
[RStudio project](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects). 
It is not a full-fledged R package because some of the pieces needed for that 
are not necessary when the main goal is to just create a set of slides and a 
couple example files. 

* `Pierce.AEA2024/`: This is the root folder for the repository.
    * `.git/`: This hidden folder is used by Git. Leave it alone!
    * `.quarto/`: This hidden folder may be created by Quarto to hold temporary 
      files. Do not edit or delete any of these files unless you know what you 
      are doing! This folder is not tracked by Git.
    * `.Rproj.user/`: This hidden folder is used by Rstudio. Leave it alone!
    * `_extensions/`: This folder contains files for Quarto extensions used by 
      my presentation slides. 
    * `data/`: This folder is intended to hold R Data files (`*.RData`). 
        * `MyStudy.RData`: This is an example data file created by 
          `scripts/Create_MyStudy_Data.qmd` and used by 
          `scripts/MyStudy_Report.qmd`. 
    * `graphics/`: This folder stores `.jpg` and `.png` graphics files used in 
      my slides. 
    * `scripts/`: The folder holds script files that I occasionally find useful. 
        * `.quarto/`: This hidden folder may be created by Quarto to hold 
          temporary files. Do not edit or delete any of these files unless you 
          know what you are doing! This folder is not tracked by Git.
        * `output/`: This folder holds rendered output from scripts in its 
          parent folder. 
            * `Create_MyStudy_Data.html`: This is created by rendering 
              `scripts/Create_MyStudy_Data.qmd`. 
            * `MyStudy_Report.html`: This is created by rendering 
              `scripts/MyStudy_Report.qmd`.
        * `.gitignore`: This file tells Git what files to ignore and omit from 
          synchronizing with the main repository on GitHub.
        * `_quarto.yml`: This is a Quarto metadata file containing folder-level 
          YAML code that will be inherited by Quarto scripts in this folder or 
          its subfolders. 
        * `Create_MyStudy_Data.qmd`: This Quarto script creates the example file 
          `data/MyStudy.RData`. The output from rendering the script is stored 
          in `scripts/output/`. 
        * `Delete_nul_file.bat`: This Windows batch files can be useful if 
          rendering problems leave behind a file called `nul` that is otherwise 
          hard to delete on Windows.
        * `MyStudy_Report.qmd`: This Quarto script is an example of a dynamic
          document used in the live demonstration during my presentation. It 
          reads in example data, then analyzes it. The rendered output is 
          stored in `scripts/output/`. 
    * `.gitignore`: This file tells Git what files to ignore and omit from 
      synchronizing with the main repository on GitHub.
    * `_quarto.yml`: This is a Quarto metadata file containing project-level 
      YAML code that will be inherited by Quarto scripts in this folder or its 
      subfolders.  
    * `apa.csl`: This is a citation style language file for the Publication 
      Manual of the American Psychological Association, 7th edition. It is used
      by Quarto to format references.
    * `apa-numeric-superscript.csl`: This is a citation style language file 
      for the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, 
      7th ed. that has been adapted to use numeric superscripts for in-text 
      citations and put the reference list in the order the citations were 
      used. It is used by Quarto to format reference sections. 
    * `apa-numeric-superscript-brackets.csl`: This is a citation style 
      language file for the Publication Manual of the American Psychological 
      Association, 7th ed. that has been adapted to use numeric superscripts
      in square brackets for in-text citations and put the reference list in 
      the order the citations were used. It is used by Quarto to format 
      reference sections. 
    * `CSTAT_theme.css`: This is custom style sheet file to provide color
      scheme, fonts, etc. for my slides. 
    * `Pierce.AEA2024.Rproj`: This is an RStudio project file. It contains some 
      settings for working with the project in that software. 
    * `README.md`: This file is obtained by knitting the `README.qmd` file and 
      is used by GitHub to display information about the repository. Do not edit 
      it manually: just re-knit `README.qmd` to update it. In R Studio, you can 
      read the formatted version by opening the file and clicking the Preview 
      button.
    * `README.qmd`: This file gives an introduction to the repository. Rendering
      it produces the `README.md` file and opens the preview automatically. 
    * `references.bib`: This is a BibTeX file containing citation data for 
      papers, software, etc. that we want to cite anywhere in our Quarto 
      scripts throughout the package. 
    * `Slides.html`: This output file contains the actual slides I used to give 
      the presentation. 
    * `Slides.qmd`: Rendering this Quarto script creates my HTML slides. 

## Rendering The Scripts
This section is for users who want to do more than just casually examine the 
slides and example files side by side. The best way to learn is to actually 
install all the software and then try rendering some files yourself. To render 
either my presentation slides or my other example Quarto scripts from the source 
code:

* Install the necessary 
  [software for reproducible research with R](https://sjpierce.github.io/rr_software.html) 
* Download or clone the repository to your computer (preferably using Git). 
* Open the resulting folder called `Pierce.AEA2024`. 
* Double-click the `Pierce.AEA2024.Rproj` file from Windows Explorer to open the 
  RStudio project. 
* Use RStudio to open the relevant Quarto script file (e.g., `Slides.qmd`).
* Click the *Render* button in RStudio source editor pane. 

That will generate the output file (e.g., `Slides.html`) and overwrite any prior 
version of it that exists in your local copy of the repository.
