# Section 1

## Reproducible Research (RR)

... is achieved when investigators *share all the materials required to exactly 
recreate the findings* so that others can verify them or conduct alternative 
analyses.

## RR is a Product

```{dot}
//| fig-width: 9
//| fig-height: 4
digraph G {
rankdir="TB";

node [shape = "box", style= "filled", fontname="Lato", fillcolor = "#C3FFEC"]
Quant [label = "Quantitative Methods"]
Qual [label = "Qualitative Methods"]
Mixed [label = "Mixed Methods"]
RR [label = "Reproducible Research"]

Quant -> Mixed -> RR
Quant -> RR
Qual -> Mixed
Qual -> RR
}
```

RR is a product of *how we work*, not which methods we use. 

::: {.notes}
RR is a product of the research process that’s presumably independent of whether 
we use quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods. What matters is how we work 
and share the materials. However, I suspect it’s easier to apply RR principles 
to quantitative methods and, as a statistician, I've primarily invested in that 
set of skills.

## Benefits of Reproducibility

* Accuracy
* Efficiency
* Credibility

:::

## Manual Workflow
* Use graphical user interface for software instead of coding scripts
* Manually updating data files 
* Version control through saving to new file names
* Disorganized folders & files 
* Copy & paste output from stats software to word processor

## Reproducible Workflow

* Eliminate manual steps!
* Produce fully-formatted, publication-quality reports:
    * Narrative text, headings
    * Software code (optional)
    * Dynamically inserted statistical results
    * Dynamic tables
    * Dynamic figures 
    * Dynamic reference sections
